Blinking LED using Arduino Uno

## Description
This project demonstrates a basic blinking LED using Arduino Uno.  
The LED turns ON and OFF at regular intervals using Arduino programming.

## Components Used
- Arduino Uno
- LED
- 220Ω Resistor
- Jumper Wires

## Working Principle
The LED is connected to a digital pin of the Arduino.  
Using the `delay()` function, the LED is turned ON and OFF every one second.

## Features
- Simple Arduino beginner project
- Demonstrates digital output control
- Easy to understand and implement

## Language Used
Embedded C/C++ (Arduino)

## Code Explanation
- `pinMode()` sets the LED pin as OUTPUT  
- `digitalWrite()` controls LED ON/OFF  
- `delay()` creates a time gap between states  

## Simulation / Implementation
Designed and simulated using Tinkercad Circuits.

## Applications
- Learning Arduino basics
- Understanding digital I/O
- Embedded systems fundamentals
